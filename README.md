Set up an Python script to bypass Twitter API. 

## Twitter's API is pointless
* unless i wanted to kitty-script up some spambots, there is not point to using their unnecessarily
  limited API. 

* There is essentially no technological difference between me going through these pages with a browser
  or scrolling on these pages. Yet, Twitter outright bans the use of web crawlers on their website. I
  would understand if it was to protect anyone's privacy, but I'm not surpassing any blocks they have 
  on webpages and, in this context, I am definitely not infringing on copywrited data because it is 
  coming out of the mouth of a public figure. Likewise, reading robots text is traditionally the way to
  go, but instead Twitter says I need written permission before I scrape their site. This is entirely 
  nonsense. Did Google ask every single website owner whether it could crawl the expanse of the internet?
  No, because that would be absolutely insane.

### So this is...
A web scraper for Twitter that doesn't really scrape so much as browse.
